# Password-Generator

## Description

```
I was tasked with making a password generator that asks the user the length of the password they wish to have and the types of characters they would like to have like uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The website is also supposed to check if the user has less than 8 characters, more than 128 characters, and/or chose to not have any types of characters and stop the user to correct the issue so that they can stay within the parameters. 
```

## Installation

```
If you wish to install this for future development you can follow these steps
    1. Fork the repository from Github (The link to the github is: 
        https://github.com/EvoL1e/Password-Generator)
    2. Clone the repository by going to the green code button
    3. Open up GitBash (Windows) or Terminal (MacOs) and write down git clone (SSH key link from the green code button)
    4. Once cloned go to wherever you your cloned files set up to go to
    5. Open the file with your IDE of choice and start coding or right click the index.html file and and look at the website locally on your machine.
```

## Usage

```
If you would like to use the password generator you can go to the link below and get your own randomized password. When you click the generate button it will ask how long you'd like your password and what type of characters within the password you would like before it generates it and prints it to the box.
